This repo contains labs and Traffic lights controllers project.

There are traffic lights at a pedestrian crossing. Normally the lights show green to cars and red to pedestrians.
When a pedestrian presses the button at the crossing the lights show yellow to the cars for 5 seconds. Then lights show red to cars and green to pedestrians for 15 seconds. After that the cars are displayed yellow and pedestrians red for 5 seconds. Then cars get at least 15 seconds of green even if the pedestrian button is pressed. However the controller must register button press and start pedestrian sequence after the 15 second period.
